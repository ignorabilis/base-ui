## Synopsis

This is my personal website, ignorabilis.com.

## Motivation

I needed a website.

## API Reference

Nothing exposed as an external API as of today.

## Tests

Tests are an unnecessary evil.
Programming functionally, with a REPL, should be enough to cover me.
I hope the future will prove me to be right.

## Contributors

Only me, IYS.

## License

This software is mine :D.
